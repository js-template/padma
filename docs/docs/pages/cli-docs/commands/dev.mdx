# Development Command

## Overview
The `dev` command starts the development server for the `@padmadev/core` package. It validates the project setup and uses the appropriate package manager to run the development server in the `core` folder.

## **Usage**
Run the following command:

```bash
npx padma dev
```



2. **Validate Core Directory**  
   - Confirms the `core` folder exists.
   - Suggests running `npx padma generate core` if the folder is missing.

3. **Detect Package Manager**  
   - Detects the package manager based on the presence of lock files:
     - `yarn.lock` → Yarn
     - `pnpm-lock.yaml` → pnpm
     - `package-lock.json` → npm

4. **Run the Dev Command**  
   - Executes the corresponding `dev` script:
     - `yarn dev`, `pnpm dev`, or `npm run dev`.
