# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

Welcome to **Padma** — your full-stack framework for building powerful Strapi + Next.js applications.
Follow this quick guide to get your project running in just a few steps!

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js** (v20 or higher)
* **PostgreSQL** (running and accessible)
* **pnpm** (recommended package manager)

To install **pnpm**, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm@latest
```

---

## 🪣 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the official Padma repository to your own GitHub account:

👉 [Fork from GitHub](https://github.com/js-template/padma)

Once forked, clone your repository and open it in your favorite code editor (such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/js-template/padma.git
cd padma
```

---

### Step 2. Configure Environment Variables

Inside both the `apps/backend` and `apps/frontend` folders, you’ll find `.env.example` files.
Rename each to `.env` and update the values accordingly.

* **Backend configuration:**
  `apps/backend/.env.example` → `apps/backend/.env`

* **Frontend configuration:**
  `apps/frontend/.env.example` → `apps/frontend/.env`

### Step 3. Connect Padma to Your Backend

Set your backend URL in the Padma configuration to connect your frontend and Strapi backend.

### Step 4. Choose or Customize Your Theme

You can:

* Start with a **free** or **premium** theme
* Or design your own using **MUI** for a modern, responsive look

---

### Step 5. Run the Backend

From the root directory, start the backend server:

```bash
pnpm -F backend dev
```

You should see output confirming the Strapi backend is running at
👉 **[http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337)**

---

### Step 6. Run the Frontend

Before running the frontend, ensure you’ve set your Strapi auth token in:

`apps/frontend/.env`

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

Then start the frontend server:

```bash
pnpm -F frontend dev
```

Your site will be available at 👉 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

> 💡 **Note:** Your frontend won’t auto-refresh for changes made outside the `packages` directory.
> You’ll need to manually refresh your browser after such changes.
