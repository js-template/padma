## **Getting Started:**

If you’re new to development, don’t worry! This guide will help you set up the project with ease.

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this GitHub repository to copy it to your account.

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables
For both the `apps/backend` and `apps/site` folders, create an `.env` file and add the required environment variables. The `.env.example` files will guide you on what’s needed.

### Step 3: Run the Backend
To start the backend (Strapi CMS), navigate to the `apps/backend` directory and run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Step 4: Run the Frontend
In another terminal, navigate to the apps/site directory and run:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
This will launch the frontend, and the site will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Step 5: Explore and Customize
Once everything is up and running, you can begin exploring the code, customizing themes, and adding your own content through the Strapi admin panel at http://localhost:1337/admin.
